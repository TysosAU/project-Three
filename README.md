# project-Three
this project consists of a Web API with http methods including GET, POST, DELETE, and PUT that interacts with a MongoDB database. It also includes a login endpoint where a user can login and on successful login retrieve a JWT returned from the API to help authenticate based on their role and also a register endpoint where a new user can register. 


To be able to make this work you need to set up your own MongoDB database and add in the necessary collections with the necessary indexes. a method that seeds the database has also been added to seed any empty collections in the database.
